synopsis:               Memoization combinators using arrays for finite sub-domains of functions

description:            Memoization combinators are great for providing high-performance Haskell programs,
			but they can be even faster if memoization is performed on a finite, discrete domain
			since an array can then be used to store results. 
			.
			This package provides various combinators for doing just this, including also 
			combinators for quanitzing and discretizing Float/Double-valued functions.
			.
			Example:
			.
			@
			  fib' :: (Int -> Int) -> Int -> Int
			  fib' _ 0 = 1
			  fib' _ 1 = 1
			  fib' rec n = rec (n - 1) + rec (n - 2)

			  -- Memoizes fib between 0 and 1000 (after that it is a run-time error)
			  fib :: Int -> Int
			  fib = arrayMemoFix (0, 1000) fib'
			@
